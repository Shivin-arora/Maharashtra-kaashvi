<img src="images/gateway.jpg" width="1325" height="400" style="border-radius:15px;">
<font size="5px"><p>The Gateway of India, with its regal arches, stands guard facing the Arabian Sea at Apollo Bunder in bustling
     Colaba area of Mumbai. The most popular tourist attraction, it is the unofficial icon of the city of Mumbai 
     and is a reminder of its rich colonial history as Bombay. The first structure to welcome visitors entering 
     the city by sea, it is popularly called ‘Taj Mahal of Mumbai’. It stands at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji 
     Marg at the water’s edge. Visited by tourists and locals alike, the gateway and its promenade affords a great
      view of the boat-studded sea and is the connecting point for boat rides to and from the famous Elephanta 
      Caves. The ‘Elephanta Festival of music and dance’ which was earlier held at the Elephanta caves, is now held
       in front of the Gateway in March every year. It is often confused with the India Gate in Delhi built in the
        memory of the 82,000 soldiers of the undivided Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First 
        World War.</p></font>

<font size="5px"><p>Ajanta and Ellora caves, considered to be one of the finest examples of ancient rock-cut caves,
     are located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, India. Ajanta and Ellora caves complex is adorned with beautiful 
     sculptures, paintings, and frescoes and include Buddhist monasteries, Hindu and Jain temples. The Ajanta caves
      are 29 in number and were built between the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD, whereas the Ellora Caves are
       more spread out and 34 in number and dates to the period between 6th and 11th Century AD.Ajanta and Ellora 
       caves are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are quite popular among travelers worldwide. Ajanta
        Caves, located around 99km north of Aurangabad, are mostly Buddhist sites and were used as a retreat by
         Buddhist Monks. Ellora is just 15 km west of Aurangabad and has a better mix of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist
          sites. These hand-carved caves were built and sponsored by the Indian rulers of those periods and almost 
          buried by thick forests. One of the most famous places in the entire Ajanta and Ellora Caves is the 
          Kailash Temple, which is also the single most massive monolithic structure globally. These rock-cut caves
           containing carvings are some of the best examples of ancient Indian architecture and sculpture.

<img src="images/ecaves.jpg" width="1325" height="400" style="border-radius:15px;">

<font size="5px"><p>The Elephanta Caves are located in Western India on Elephanta Island (otherwise known as
      the Island of Gharapuri), which features two hillocks separated by a narrow valley. The small island is 
      dotted with numerous ancient archaeological remains that are the sole testimonies to its rich cultural past. 
      These archaeological remains reveal evidence of occupation from as early as the 2nd century BC. The rock-cut
       Elephanta Caves were constructed about the mid-5th to 6th centuries AD. The most important among the caves 
       is the great Cave 1, which measures 39 metres from the front entrance to the back. In plan, this cave in the
        western hill closely resembles Dumar Lena cave at Ellora, in India. The main body of the cave, excluding 
        the porticos on the three open sides and the back aisle, is 27 metres square and is supported by rows of 
        six columns each.</p></font>
