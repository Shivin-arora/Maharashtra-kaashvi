<FONT SIZE="6PX" COLOR="YELLOW"><u>HOURS OF SUNSHINE PER DAY</u>
<P>The number of hours of sunshine refers to the time when the sun is actually visible. That is, without any
 obstruction of visibility by clouds, fog or mountains. With 9 hours perday, February is the sunniest month in 
 country part Maharashtra. In July the sun shines the shortest.</P>
 <br>
<br>
<u>RAINY DAYS PER MONTH</u>
<P>A rainy day is a day on which at least an amount of 0.1 mm precipitation (=0.1 liter) per 
square meter falls. This can be rain, snow, hail or even dew. So it does not have to rain the whole day. 
With 21 rainy days, July offers the most number of rainy days, and in December the least.</P>
<br>
<br>
<u>PRECIPITATION IN MM/DAY</u>
<P>The amount of precipitation is measured in millimeters per square meter. Thus, at 2 mm/day, 2 liters of water 
fall on one square meterwithin 24 hours. With only 0.13 mm, the least rain falls in February. July, on the other
 hand, has the most rain</P>
 <br>
 <br>
 <u>WATER TEMPRATURE
<P>Water temperature depends not only on solar radiation within the same region, but also on ocean currents. 
For example, depending on the season, cold or warm water masses are moved from other areas. The warmest 
temperatures in Maharashtra are in May, when the water is 29 Â°C.</P></FONT>
