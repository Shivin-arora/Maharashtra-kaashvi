            <h2>The mighty Arabian Sea makes up the west coast of Maharashtra. Running parallel to this coast are the 
                Sahyadri Hills, also known as the Western Ghats, which rise upto the height of 1,200 meters (4,000 feet).
                 To the east of the ghats lies the Deccan Plateau. On the other hand, the Konkan coastal plains are situated
                  to their west and boast of a width of 50-80 kilometers. Western Ghats are one of the three watersheds of 
                  India and it is from here that most of the rivers in South India have found their origin.</h2>
