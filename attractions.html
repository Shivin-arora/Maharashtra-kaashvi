        LONAR LAKE
        <P>Lonar Lake, also known as Lonar crater, is a notified National Geo-heritage Monument, saline,
         soda lake, located at Lonar in Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India. Lonar Lake was created by a
          meteorite collision impact during the Pleistocene Epoch. It is one of the four known, 
          hyper-velocity, impact craters in basaltic rock anywhere on Earth. The other three basaltic impact
          structures are in southern Brazil. Lonar Lake has a mean diameter of 1.2 kilometres (3,900 ft) and is
           about 137 metres (449 ft) below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about 1.8 kilometres (5,900 ft)
            in diameter. India's Lonar Crater began causing confusion soon after it was identified in 1823 by a 
            British.</P>

        GATEWAY OF INDIA 
        <P>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai, India.
         It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit
          India, in December 1911 at Ramchandani Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk.The foundation stone was
           laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements of 
           16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was
            sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made
             of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch
              as well as Gujarati architecture of the time
